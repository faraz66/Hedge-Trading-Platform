# Grid Trading Strategy Documentation

## Overview
The Grid Trading Strategy is a systematic trading approach that creates a network of buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels. This strategy profits from price oscillations within a range while also adapting to trending markets.

## Strategy Parameters

### grid_size (Integer)
- **Description**: Number of grid levels above and below the initial price
- **Range**: 5 to 50
- **Default**: 20
- **Step**: 1
- **Significance**: Determines how many price levels are created in the grid. More levels mean more potential trades but smaller profit per trade. Consider market volatility when setting this parameter.

### grid_spacing (Float)
- **Description**: Percentage distance between grid levels
- **Range**: 0.001 to 0.05 (0.1% to 5%)
- **Default**: 0.005 (0.5%)
- **Step**: 0.001
- **Significance**: Sets how far apart the grid levels are. Larger spacing means fewer but potentially more profitable trades. Should be adjusted based on asset volatility.

### size_multiplier (Float)
- **Description**: Multiplier for position sizes
- **Range**: 0.1 to 5.0
- **Default**: 1.0
- **Step**: 0.1
- **Significance**: Adjusts the overall position size. Higher values increase risk and potential reward. Use cautiously as it directly impacts exposure.

### min_profit (Float)
- **Description**: Minimum profit target per trade
- **Range**: 0.0001 to 0.01 (0.01% to 1%)
- **Default**: 0.001 (0.1%)
- **Step**: 0.0001
- **Significance**: Sets the minimum profit required before closing a trade. Higher values may result in fewer but more profitable trades. Consider transaction costs when setting this parameter.

### stop_loss (Float)
- **Description**: Stop loss percentage
- **Range**: 0.005 to 0.05 (0.5% to 5%)
- **Default**: 0.02 (2%)
- **Step**: 0.005
- **Significance**: Sets the percentage at which a losing position will be automatically closed to limit losses. Critical for risk management in volatile markets.

### trend_period (Integer)
- **Description**: Period for trend calculation
- **Range**: 10 to 50
- **Default**: 20
- **Step**: 1
- **Significance**: Determines how many candles are used to calculate the trend. Higher values create smoother trends that react more slowly to price changes, reducing false signals.

### risk_per_trade (Float)
- **Description**: Risk per trade as a fraction of account
- **Range**: 0.001 to 0.05 (0.1% to 5%)
- **Default**: 0.01 (1%)
- **Step**: 0.001
- **Significance**: Controls what percentage of the account balance is risked on each trade. Higher values increase potential returns but also increase risk. Essential for proper position sizing.

## Strategy Logic
1. Creates a grid of buy and sell orders around the current price
2. Automatically places counter-orders when grid levels are hit
3. Adapts grid placement based on trend direction
4. Manages risk through position sizing and stop-losses
5. Monitors overall exposure and adjusts accordingly

## Best Practices
- Start with conservative parameters in volatile markets
- Regularly monitor and adjust grid spacing based on market conditions
- Use proper position sizing to manage risk effectively
- Consider transaction costs when setting minimum profit targets
- Backtest thoroughly before live trading
- Monitor overall market trend for optimal grid placement

## Risk Management
- Use stop-losses to protect against significant market moves
- Monitor total exposure across all grid levels
- Consider using a maximum drawdown limit
- Regularly review and adjust parameters based on performance
- Keep position sizes appropriate for account size
