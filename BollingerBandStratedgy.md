# Bollinger Breakout Strategy Documentation

## Overview
The Bollinger Breakout Strategy is a technical trading strategy that uses Bollinger Bands to identify potential breakout opportunities in cryptocurrency markets. The strategy generates buy signals when price breaks above the upper band and sell signals when price breaks below the lower band.

## Strategy Parameters

### bb_period (Integer)
- **Description**: Period for Bollinger Bands calculation
- **Range**: 10 to 50
- **Default**: 20
- **Step**: 5
- **Significance**: Determines how many candles are used to calculate the moving average for Bollinger Bands. Higher values create smoother bands that react more slowly to price changes, reducing false signals but potentially delaying entry/exit points.

### bb_std (Float) 
- **Description**: Number of standard deviations for bands
- **Range**: 1.5 to 3.0
- **Default**: 2.0
- **Step**: 0.1
- **Significance**: Controls how wide the Bollinger Bands are. Higher values create wider bands, resulting in fewer but potentially more reliable signals. Lower values generate more signals but increase the risk of false breakouts.

### amount (Integer)
- **Description**: Amount to trade per signal
- **Range**: 50 to 200
- **Default**: 100
- **Step**: 50
- **Significance**: Determines the position size for each trade. This parameter directly impacts risk and potential returns. Larger amounts increase both potential profits and losses.

### stop_loss (Float)
- **Description**: Stop loss percentage
- **Range**: 0.01 to 0.05 (1% to 5%)
- **Default**: 0.02 (2%)
- **Step**: 0.005
- **Significance**: Sets the percentage below (for buys) or above (for sells) the entry price where a position will be automatically closed to limit losses. Critical for risk management.

### take_profit (Float)
- **Description**: Take profit percentage
- **Range**: 0.03 to 0.06 (3% to 6%)
- **Default**: 0.04 (4%)
- **Step**: 0.005
- **Significance**: Sets the percentage above (for buys) or below (for sells) the entry price where a position will be automatically closed to secure profits. Helps maintain a positive risk-reward ratio.

## Strategy Logic
1. Calculates Bollinger Bands using the specified period and standard deviation
2. Generates buy signals on upper band breakouts
3. Generates sell signals on lower band breakouts
4. Manages positions using stop-loss and take-profit levels
5. Controls risk through position sizing

## Best Practices
- Start with default parameters and adjust based on backtesting results
- Consider market volatility when adjusting bb_std
- Maintain reasonable risk levels through proper position sizing
- Use in conjunction with other technical indicators for confirmation
